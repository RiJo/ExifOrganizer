The idea is to select a source path to be organized, where media files (mainly images, but also videos and music) is gathered from. Those files are then copied and structured into a destination path. How the media files are organized is configrable via a graphical user interface (GUI) or by command line interface (CLI) for scripting.

## Environment
Everything is written in C# using Visual Studio 2012. There are no external dependencies.
